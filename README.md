My Weather App is an app using the Weather API to give the user the current temperature and weather conditions based on the location the user enters:

The way to use the app is to enter the desired location using zipcode, city, or coordinates, and the app gives the user the temperature, weather conditions, and a clothing suggestion.

This app was created using HTML, CSS, JS/JQuery
